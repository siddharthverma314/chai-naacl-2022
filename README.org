* Installation Steps
The minimum python version required for this repo is =3.8=. Install this package by running the following command in the main directory:

#+begin_src bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  export PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PYTHONPATH
#+end_src

* Reproducing our results
We list all steps required to reproduce our results and baselines below.

** Download data
To download all data required for the experiments and baselines, navigate to the data folder and run `make`. To only download data for training CHAI, run `make dataset`. To remove all downloaded files, run `make clean`.

** Finetuning the Language Model
We use GPT-2 as our language model. To finetune GPT-2 on the craigslist dataset, determine the largest batch size that your GPU can hold, and run the following command from the base directory =scripts/transformers=:

#+begin_src bash
  python finetune_gpt2.py \
	 --gpt2-type gpt2-medium \
	 --train-fp ../../data/train.json \
	 --val-fp ../../data/dev.json \
	 --batch-size <BATCH_SIZE> \
	 --output-dir ./logs/gpt2
#+end_src

We then use the Finetuned GPT to generate candidates and embeddings via the following command:

#+begin_src bash
  python generate_sentences.py <CHECKPOINT_DIR>
  python generate_embeddings.py <CHECKPOINT_DIR>
#+end_src

where =<CHECKPOINT_DIR>= is the directory created from the previous command, for example, =logs/gpt2/checkpoint-2000/=.

This should create =sentences.pkl= and =embeddings.pkl= files.

** Training the RL agent
After generating the candidates and embeddings, we can train CHAI by using the scripts in the =scripts/train= directory. For example, to train CHAI with EMAQ, run

#+begin_src bash
  python chai_emaq.py \
	   --logdir ./logs/chai \
	   --filepath ./data/train.json \
	   --embeddings <PATH TO embeddings.pkl> \
	   --sentences <PATH TO sentences.pkl>
#+end_src

* Evaluate the model
To play around with CHAI, run the following command:

#+begin_src bash
  python eval.py \
	 --data-path <path to test.json> \
	 --gpt-dir <gpt checkpoint> \
	 --checkpoint-file <chai checkpoint> \
	 --buyer human \
	 --seller ours \
	 --num-rollouts 50 \
	 --output-path "results_human.json" \
	 --debug
#+end_src

The =eval.py= script also contains options for the automatic evaluations done in the paper, which can be accomplished by changing the =buyer= option to different values. Check out the script for more details.
